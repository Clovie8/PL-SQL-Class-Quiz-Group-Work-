# PL-SQL-Class-Quiz-Group-Work-
Working together as a group of three students. To discuss, design and prepare a short report for task of Creating table, perform different type of joins, create an index, create a view and simple report. 

## What we did: 
- Created Authors, Books, and Borrowings tables with primary/foreign keys and 
constraints.
- Inserted sample data for authors, books, and borrowing transactions.
- Used INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER JOIN queries to explore relationships.
- Created an index on Borrowings.BookID to optimize queries.
- Built a view vw_BookBorrowings to easily fetch combined data.
